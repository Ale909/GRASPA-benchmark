# GRASPA data

GRASPA 1.0 provides the following useful material to enhance reproducibility:

### Object models
- The object models of the YCB objects included in the benchmark are available [in this folder]. These models are used to generate the printable layouts and to compute the grasp quality.

### 6D poses for the reachability tests
The poses to be reached within the reaching test are collected [in this folder](). The sets of poses to test the robot reachability on are three:

   TODO ADD image

The poses are defined considering the hand reference frame attached on the robot hand as follows:

   TODO iCub hand

We also provide the set of poses in case the hand reference frame is the following:


In this case, only one set of poses changes (use [this xml file]() instead of [this one]()):


**Note** If the end-effector of the test robot  has a reference frame with a different orientation w.r.t the one shown in the previous pictures, the user is supposed to transform the desired poses so to make all the poses have the approaching direction of the end-effector parallel to the x-axes of the poses defined within GRASPA. These ways the poses tested during the reachability tests are coeherent with the movements executed by the test robot.

### 6D poses for the camera calibration tests
The poses to be reached within the camera calibration test are collected [in this file(). The sets of poses to test the robot reachability is only one:


The poses are defined considering the hand reference frame attached on the robot hand as follows:

   TODO iCub hand

We also provide the set of poses in case the hand reference frame is the following:

In this case, only one set of poses changes (use [this xml file]() instead of [this one]()):



### Grasping scenarios
GRASPA 1.0 comes with  3 increasingly challenging layouts, in terms of number of involved objects, their pose within the test area and their graspability.
In order for layouts to be reproducible in practice, we provide printable layouts of dimensions 594x420 mm  (A2 format) that include markers and object footprints:

#### Layout 0


#### Layout 1


#### Layout 2


**Note**
GRASPA 1.0 features the printable layouts both in A2 format or in 4 combinable A4 files.

Also, two different sets of printable layouts are available:
- those with the entire marker board:

TODO

- those with missing markers from the full board:

TODO

The second option allows for properly printing the 4 combinable A4 layouts avoiding  the presence of white margins sometimes generated by the printer, which might lead to possible errors in marker detection.
